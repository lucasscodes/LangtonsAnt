This is a project to master different things in java, mainly Swing!

I got a simulation and a gui thread. The simulation is optimized to run fast, the maxRate is far below its limit! The GUI is not optimized alot and slow for bigger field sizes.

Also there are alot ToDo's left inside, it's ongoing progress.
